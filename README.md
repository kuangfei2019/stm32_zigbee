# stm32_zigbee
Stm32 communication with MRF24J40MA

This project is about controlling LED's with Radio(zigbee) and physical buttons.

This is to be implemented as my kitchen lightning over the sink.

There will be two LED's, one RGBW and a LED-panel, there will also be two buttons, one for each LED.

Three threads will be running on the STM32, one for handling the buttons, one for the radio and one for the LED-driver.
